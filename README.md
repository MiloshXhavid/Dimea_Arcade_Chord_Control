## Download

**[Latest release — v1.9](https://github.com/MiloshXhavid/Dima_Plugin_Chrdmachine/releases/latest)**

Download `DimeaArcade-ChordControl-v1.9.0-Setup.exe`, run it, rescan plugins in your DAW.

**Requirements**
- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- VST3-compatible DAW (Ableton Live, REAPER, FL Studio, Bitwig, etc.)
- Xbox, PS4, or PS5 controller — optional but recommended

---

## What it does

You move a joystick (or analog stick on a gamepad) and it plays chords. The Y axis controls the root note and third, the X axis controls the fifth and tension note. Every position snaps to the scale you choose, so everything stays in key automatically.

The four chord voices go out on separate MIDI channels so you can route them to different instruments or apply different effects per voice.

> Place the plugin on a MIDI track in your DAW, before your instrument. In Ableton Live: add it on a MIDI track, then route that track's output to an instrument track.

## Features

### Chord engine
- Y axis → root + third, X axis → fifth + tension
- 20 built-in scales (major, minor, modes, pentatonic, blues, etc.) plus a custom scale editor
- Global key/transpose, per-voice octave offsets, per-voice interval adjustments
- 4 voices on MIDI channels 1–4 (configurable per voice)
- Slew (portamento) per voice
- **Smart Chord Display** — infers correct chord quality (Cm7, Gmaj7#11, sus4, etc.) from the active scale in real time; retains last name during silence

### Triggers
- **Touchplate** — 4 pads, one per voice, velocity sensitive
- **Joystick** — trigger all voices when the stick leaves center
- **Random** — generative rhythmic triggers with density, subdivision, and gate controls per voice
- Hold mode per voice

### LFO modulation
- Dual LFOs (X and Y) with oscilloscope display
- Shapes: sine, triangle, saw, ramp, square, S&H
- Targets: LFO frequency, phase, level, Gate, or any of 18 MIDI CCs
- **Sister LFO cross-modulation** — route X into Y or Y into X with a bipolar attenuator (−1…+1)
- SYNC (DAW tempo) and JOY (joystick-driven) modes
- REC lane — record one full loop cycle of LFO movement; CLR to clear

### Looper
- Record and loop chord progressions in sync with your DAW
- Record Gates / Joystick / Mod Whl lanes independently
- Adjustable time signature (3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 7/8, 9/8, 11/8) and length (1–16 bars)
- **Trigger quantization** — snap recorded MIDI to grid: Off / Live / Post, subdivisions 1/4–1/32
- Rec Lane Undo — press a lit Rec button to clear that lane individually
- Looper position bar shows playback progress in real time

### Arpeggiator
- 8-step grid (ON / TIE / OFF per cell) for melodic patterns
- LEN control (1–8 active steps); RND SYNC: FREE / INT / DAW
- Rate, order, and gate% controls

### Gamepad input
- Right stick → joystick pitch
- Left stick X/Y → configurable CC targets (default CC74 cutoff + CC71 resonance) with attenuation
- L1/L2/R1/R2 → trigger individual voices; L3 → all voices
- X → looper play/stop, Square → reset, Triangle → record, Circle → delete
- Status label shows detected controller type: PS4 / PS5 / Xbox / No controller
- **MIDI Panic** button — sends all-notes-off on all 16 MIDI channels instantly

### Custom CC routing
- LFO CC Dest and Left Stick X/Y Mode dropdowns support any CC 0–127
- Custom assignments persist in presets

### Visual
- **Resizable window** — drag corner to scale 0.75×–2.0×; aspect ratio locked; persists across save/load
- **Mini mode (◱)** / **Maxi mode (⛶)** — pad-only or pad-fills-display
- **Pitch Axis Crosshair** — live note names at joystick position; right-click pad to toggle
- Living Space Starfield — parallax layers, shooting stars, nebula blobs; crossfades with warp
- Scale keyboard display
- Velocity-sensitive knob drag (slow = fine, fast = broad sweep)
