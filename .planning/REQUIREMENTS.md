# Requirements: ChordJoystick MK2

**Defined:** 2026-02-26 (v1.4), 2026-02-28 (v1.5)
**Core Value:** XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, gesture looper with trigger quantization, and gamepad control — no competitor provides this as a unified instrument.

## v1.4 Requirements

### LFO System

- [x] **LFO-01**: User can enable/disable X-axis LFO independently (On/Off toggle)
- [x] **LFO-02**: User can enable/disable Y-axis LFO independently (On/Off toggle)
- [x] **LFO-03**: User can select waveform shape per LFO via dropdown (Sine / Triangle / Saw Up / Saw Down / Square / S&H / Random)
- [x] **LFO-04**: When Sync OFF → frequency slider (free-running rate in Hz); when Sync ON → same control becomes subdivision selector (1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32)
- [x] **LFO-05**: User can set LFO phase shift via slider (0–360°)
- [x] **LFO-06**: User can set LFO distortion (additive jitter/noise amount) via slider
- [x] **LFO-07**: User can set LFO level (modulation depth / amplitude) via slider
- [x] **LFO-08**: User can sync LFO to tempo via a single Sync button — syncs to Free BPM; when DAW sync is also active, follows DAW BPM
- [x] **LFO-09**: LFO X output modulates joystick X axis as additive offset (output clamped to -1..1)
- [x] **LFO-10**: LFO Y output modulates joystick Y axis as additive offset (output clamped to -1..1)
- [x] **LFO-11**: LFO section is positioned to the left of the joystick pad; joystick shifted right to accommodate

### Beat Clock

- [x] **CLK-01**: A flashing dot next to the Free BPM knob pulses once per beat (internal free tempo)
- [x] **CLK-02**: Beat dot follows DAW clock (pulses on DAW beat) when DAW sync is active

### Performance & Stability

- [x] **PERF-01**: LFO S&H / Random waveforms use the project's existing LCG pattern (not std::rand) — audio-thread safe under MSVC
- [x] **PERF-02**: LFO output is applied as an additive local float offset inside buildChordParams() — never writes to shared joystick atomics
- [x] **PERF-03**: Synced LFO phase derived from ppqPos (DAW mode) or sample counter (free mode) — no free-accumulation drift across transport stops

### Gamepad Preset Control

- [x] **CTRL-01**: Option button on gamepad toggles "preset scroll" mode; plugin UI shows a visible indicator when mode is active
- [x] **CTRL-02**: In preset scroll mode, the BPM up/down gamepad controls instead send MIDI Program Change +1 / −1 on a configurable MIDI channel
- [x] **CTRL-03**: Plugin UI shows an active-mode indicator ("OPTION") in the gamepad status area when preset-scroll mode is active (program number display deferred per user decision in 15-CONTEXT.md)

### Distribution

- [x] **DIST-01**: GitHub v1.4 release created with built installer binary and release notes
- [x] **DIST-02**: Full plugin copy backed up to Desktop/Dima_plug-in

## v1.5 Requirements

**Defined:** 2026-02-28
**Design decisions:**
- LFO recording: pre-distortion samples stored; Distort applied live on playback
- Arp step counter resets to 0 on toggle-off
- Looper playback in Single Channel mode uses live channel setting (not record-time)
- Random Hold mode: RND Sync applies (pad held + sync = gated synced bursts)
- Gate Length is unified across Arp + Random sources (one parameter, both systems)

### MIDI Routing

- [ ] **ROUT-01**: User can select "Multi-Channel" (voices on ch 1–4, default) or "Single Channel" (all voices → one MIDI channel) via a dropdown in the bottom-right of the UI
- [ ] **ROUT-02**: In Single Channel mode, user can select the target MIDI channel (1–16) via a second dropdown
- [ ] **ROUT-03**: In Single Channel mode, same-pitch note collisions across voices are handled via reference counting — note-off only fires when the last voice on that pitch releases
- [ ] **ROUT-04**: In Single Channel mode, all CC messages (CC74, CC71) are sent to the selected channel
- [ ] **ROUT-05**: Looper playback in Single Channel mode uses the currently selected channel (live setting, not record-time channel)

### Sub Octave

- [ ] **SUBOCT-01**: Each of the 4 voice pads has a Sub Oct toggle — right half of the existing Hold button
- [ ] **SUBOCT-02**: When Sub Oct is active for a voice, a second note-on fires exactly 12 semitones below the voice pitch on every trigger
- [ ] **SUBOCT-03**: Sub Oct note-off always matches the pitch used at note-on time (snapshotted, not recomputed at release)
- [ ] **SUBOCT-04**: User can toggle Sub Oct for a pad via gamepad by holding the pad button (R1/R2/L1/L2) and pressing R3

### Left Joystick Modulation

- [ ] **LJOY-01**: Left Joystick X dropdown offers: Filter Cutoff (CC74), Filter Resonance (CC71), LFO-X Frequency, LFO-X Phase, LFO-X Level, Gate Length
- [ ] **LJOY-02**: Left Joystick Y dropdown offers the same set with LFO-Y variants: Filter Cutoff (CC74), Filter Resonance (CC71), LFO-Y Frequency, LFO-Y Phase, LFO-Y Level, Gate Length
- [ ] **LJOY-03**: Left Joystick X dropdown appears before Left Joystick Y in the UI
- [ ] **LJOY-04**: LFO Frequency target is suppressed (stick has no effect) when that LFO's Sync mode is active

### LFO Recording

- [ ] **LFOREC-01**: An "Arm" button next to the Sync button lets the user arm LFO recording (unarmed by default — LFO does not record automatically)
- [ ] **LFOREC-02**: When armed and the looper starts recording, pre-distortion LFO output is captured into a dedicated ring buffer for exactly one loop cycle
- [ ] **LFOREC-03**: After one loop cycle, recording stops automatically and LFO switches to playback — replaying stored values in sync with the looper
- [ ] **LFOREC-04**: During LFO playback mode, Shape / Freq / Phase / Level / Sync controls are grayed out; Distort remains adjustable
- [ ] **LFOREC-05**: A "Clear" button returns LFO recording to unarmed/normal mode and re-enables all grayed-out parameters
- [ ] **LFOREC-06**: Distort is applied live on top of stored playback samples — never recorded

### Arpeggiator

- [ ] **ARP-01**: Arpeggiator steps through the current 4-voice chord at configurable Rate and Order, sending note-on/off on the active channel routing
- [ ] **ARP-02**: Arp Rate options: 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32
- [ ] **ARP-03**: Arp Order options: Up, Down, Up-Down, Random
- [ ] **ARP-04**: Arp uses the unified Gate Length parameter (shared with Random trigger source)
- [ ] **ARP-05**: When DAW sync is active, Arp on arms and waits for the next bar boundary before stepping begins
- [ ] **ARP-06**: Arp off resets the step counter to 0

### Random Trigger System

- [ ] **RND-01**: Trigger source dropdown extended to: Pad / Joystick / Random Free / Random Hold (replaces existing Pad / Joystick / Random)
- [ ] **RND-02**: Random Free mode fires gates continuously regardless of looper play state; if RND Sync is on, gates snap to the beat grid; if off, gates fire at free random intervals
- [ ] **RND-03**: Random Hold mode fires gates only while the associated pad is physically held (touchplate or gamepad button); RND Sync applies the same way as Free mode
- [ ] **RND-04**: "Population" knob (1–64) replaces the existing RND Density knob — sets the maximum number of gates fired per bar
- [ ] **RND-05**: "Probability" knob (0–100%) replaces the existing RND Gate knob — chance each scheduled population slot actually fires
- [ ] **RND-06**: Random subdivision options extended to include 1/64 (alongside existing 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32)
- [ ] **RND-07**: Unified "Gate Length" parameter (0–100% of subdivision) controls note hold duration for both Arp and Random sources; left joystick X or Y can modulate it

### Gamepad Option Mode 1

- [ ] **OPT1-01**: In Option Mode 1 — Circle toggles Arp on/off; turning on resets looper to beat 0 and starts playback (or arms if DAW sync is active)
- [ ] **OPT1-02**: In Option Mode 1 — Triangle steps Arp Rate up (1 press = one step up through 1/4 → 1/8 → 1/16 → 1/32); 2 quick presses = one step down
- [ ] **OPT1-03**: In Option Mode 1 — Square steps Arp Order with the same two-press architecture (Up → Down → Up-Down → Random)
- [ ] **OPT1-04**: In Option Mode 1 — X button toggles RND Sync (the existing `randomClockSync` parameter)
- [ ] **OPT1-05**: In any mode — holding a pad button (R1/R2/L1/L2) and pressing R3 toggles Sub Oct for that voice
- [ ] **OPT1-06**: R3 pressed alone no longer sends MIDI Panic — panic is UI button only
- [ ] **OPT1-07**: Option Mode 2 (existing D-pad Program Change scrolling) continues working unchanged

### Bug Fixes

- [ ] **BUG-01**: Looper playback starts at the correct beat position after a record cycle completes (no anchor drift or offset)
- [x] **BUG-02**: Plugin does not crash when PS4 controller reconnects via Bluetooth (SDL2 double-open guard)

### Distribution

- [ ] **DIST-03**: GitHub v1.5 release created with built installer binary and release notes
- [ ] **DIST-04**: Full plugin copy backed up to Desktop

## Future Requirements (v2+)

### LFO Extensions

- **LFO-EXT-01**: LFO modulation of filter CC (CC74/CC71) as a second injection point
- **LFO-EXT-02**: Triplet and dotted note sync subdivisions (1/4T, 1/8T, etc.)
- **LFO-EXT-03**: LFO-to-LFO modulation (X LFO modulates Y LFO rate)

### Beat Clock

- **CLK-EXT-01**: Audible metronome click (MIDI note on dedicated channel) — requires routing decision

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| juce_dsp module | isMidiEffect()=true — SIMD audio buffer abstractions meaningless |
| LFO modulation written back to APVTS | Illegal from audio thread; would impose 20ms smoother |
| Continuous pitch vibrato from LFO | Existing pitch is sample-and-hold at trigger time — LFO varies pitch at next trigger |
| Soft sync (LFO gradually drifts to phase) | Hard reset on transport start is industry standard; soft sync adds complexity with no UX benefit |
