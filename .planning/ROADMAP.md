## Phase Details

### Phase 12: LFO Engine Core
**Goal**: A fully tested, audio-thread-safe LFO DSP class exists as a standalone unit with all waveforms and performance guarantees met
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (codebase in v1.3 state)
**Requirements**: LFO-03, LFO-04, LFO-05, LFO-06, LFO-07, PERF-01, PERF-02, PERF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 7 waveforms (Sine, Triangle, Saw Up, Saw Down, Square, S&H, Random) produce output normalized to [-1, 1] — verified by Catch2 unit tests
  2. S&H waveform holds a constant value for an entire cycle period and jumps instantaneously at the cycle boundary — no interpolation between steps
  3. LFO phase in sync mode is derived from ppqPos (DAW playing) or a sample counter (free mode) — no free-accumulating phase drift on transport stop/start
  4. S&H and Random waveforms use the project's existing LCG pattern (`seed * 1664525u + 1013904223u`), never `std::rand()` — no CRT mutex acquisition on the audio thread
  5. LFO output is computed as a local float value; no write-back to shared `joystickX`/`joystickY` atomics occurs anywhere in LfoEngine
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — LfoEngine DSP class: all 7 waveforms, LCG, sync/free modes, S&H boundary detection (completed 2026-02-26)
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — Catch2 tests and CMakeLists update: build test target, prove all success criteria (completed 2026-02-26)

### Phase 13: processBlock Integration and APVTS
**Goal**: The LFO modulates joystick X and Y axes during every processBlock call, with all parameters automatable by the DAW host and presets load without breaking v1.3 state
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: LFO-01, LFO-02, LFO-08, LFO-09, LFO-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Enabling either LFO with level > 0 causes audible pitch variation on the corresponding voices (X-axis LFO affects fifth/tension voices, Y-axis LFO affects root/third voices) — verifiable in DAW MIDI monitor
  2. Setting LFO enabled to Off stops modulation immediately without any note hanging or stuck output
  3. With DAW sync active and Sync ON, LFO phase locks to DAW beat — restarting transport resets LFO to phase 0
  4. Loading a v1.3 preset produces all existing parameters at their saved values and all new LFO parameters at safe defaults (enabled=false, level=0) — no parameter ID collisions
  5. All 16 new LFO parameters appear in the DAW automation lane and respond to automation playback
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — PluginProcessor.h/cpp: 16 APVTS params, lfoX_/lfoY_ members, processBlock LFO injection with ramp, prepareToPlay + transport resets (completed 2026-02-26)

### Phase 14: LFO UI and Beat Clock
**Goal**: The player can control both LFOs and see beat timing through the plugin UI without opening the DAW
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: LFO-11, CLK-01, CLK-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Two LFO panels are visible to the left of the joystick pad; the joystick pad is shifted right to accommodate — no controls overlap or are clipped at the editor boundary
  2. Each LFO panel contains a shape dropdown, Rate slider (Hz in free mode / subdivision selector in sync mode), Phase slider, Distortion slider, Level slider, Enabled toggle, and Sync button — all controls function and save with the preset
  3. A small dot next to the Free BPM knob flashes once per beat when free tempo is active, and switches to flashing on DAW beats when DAW sync is active
  4. Toggling Sync on an LFO panel switches the Rate control label and behavior between Hz display and subdivision steps — no UI glitch or layout shift
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — PluginProcessor.h/cpp: beatOccurred_, modulatedJoyX_/Y_ atomics + processBlock beat detection and modulated position stores (completed 2026-02-26)
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — PluginEditor.h/cpp: 1120px layout, LFO X/Y panel columns, all controls + APVTS attachments, Sync toggle Rate swap (completed 2026-02-26)
- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — PluginEditor.cpp: JoystickPad LFO tracking dot via modulatedJoyX_/Y_ + 7-issue layout overhaul (completed 2026-02-26)

### Phase 15: Gamepad Preset Control
**Goal**: The Option button on the PS/Xbox controller switches the BPM±1 controls into MIDI Program Change mode, with a subtle "OPTION" indicator in the gamepad status area of the plugin UI
**Depends on**: Phase 14 (UI framework in place)
**Requirements**: CTRL-01, CTRL-02, CTRL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pressing the Option button activates preset-scroll mode and a visible indicator appears in the plugin UI; pressing again deactivates it
  2. In preset-scroll mode, the gamepad controls that normally increment/decrement BPM instead send MIDI Program Change +1 / −1 on the configured MIDI channel — verified in DAW MIDI monitor
  3. The plugin UI shows an "OPTION" suffix on the gamepad status label in highlight color when preset-scroll mode is active
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — GamepadInput.h/cpp: Option/Guide button toggle, presetScrollActive_, consumePcDelta(), one-frame lockout (completed 2026-02-26)
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — PluginProcessor.h/cpp: program counter + PC message routing; PluginEditor.cpp: OPTION indicator in gamepadStatusLabel_ (completed 2026-02-26)

### Phase 16: Distribution
**Goal**: v1.4 is publicly released on GitHub and backed up locally
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A GitHub release tagged `v1.4` exists with the installer binary attached and a release notes body listing the LFO + beat clock features
  2. A copy of the built plugin and installer is present at `Desktop/Dima_Plug-in/v1.4/` — confirmed by directory listing
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — Update .iss for v1.4, rebuild installer, smoke test checkpoint (completed 2026-02-26)
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md — Retag v1.4 to HEAD, create GitHub release, desktop backup (completed 2026-02-26)

---

### Phase 17: Bug Fixes
**Goal**: Two known correctness defects are eliminated so that the codebase is a stable foundation for all v1.5 feature work — the looper no longer drifts after a record cycle, and the plugin no longer crashes when a PS4 reconnects via Bluetooth
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: BUG-01, BUG-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After recording a loop and letting it play back, the first beat of every subsequent cycle aligns exactly with the DAW grid — no audible phase offset or late-start drift
  2. Disconnecting and reconnecting a PS4 controller via Bluetooth during a live session does not crash the plugin and the controller resumes normal operation within one reconnect cycle
  3. Both fixes pass a pluginval level 5 run with no new failures introduced
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 18: Single-Channel Routing
**Goal**: Users can route all four voices to a single configurable MIDI channel so that any monophonic or paraphonic synthesizer can be driven by the plugin without per-voice MIDI channel setup in the DAW
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: ROUT-01, ROUT-02, ROUT-03, ROUT-04, ROUT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A "Multi-Channel / Single Channel" dropdown is visible in the bottom-right of the plugin UI; switching to Single Channel reveals a second channel selector (1–16)
  2. In Single Channel mode all four voices, CC74, and CC71 messages arrive on the same MIDI channel in the DAW MIDI monitor — no messages appear on other channels
  3. Pressing two pads simultaneously that produce the same pitch in Single Channel mode results in exactly one note-on and one note-off — no doubled velocity and no stuck note
  4. Looper playback in Single Channel mode sends notes on the currently selected channel even if the channel was different at record time
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 19: Sub Octave Per Voice
**Goal**: Players can add a parallel bass note exactly one octave below any individual voice, controllable per-pad from both the UI and the gamepad, enabling bass-doubling without affecting the other voices
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: SUBOCT-01, SUBOCT-02, SUBOCT-03, SUBOCT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each of the four voice pads displays a Sub Oct toggle (right half of the existing Hold button); activating it causes a second note at exactly -12 semitones to sound simultaneously on every trigger for that voice
  2. Releasing a pad with Sub Oct active sends a note-off for the sub-octave note at the exact pitch that was sent at note-on time — no stuck sub-octave notes even if the joystick moved between press and release
  3. Holding a pad button on the gamepad (R1/R2/L1/L2) and pressing R3 toggles Sub Oct for that voice — confirmed by the UI toggle updating visually
  4. Sub Oct state survives preset save and load — a preset saved with Sub Oct on for voice 1 reloads with Sub Oct on for voice 1
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 20: Random Trigger System Extensions
**Goal**: The random trigger source becomes expressive and composable — players can choose between continuous free-firing and held-pad burst modes, set a population ceiling and per-slot probability, access 1/64 subdivision, and gate length is available as a unified parameter shared with the arpeggiator
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Requirements**: RND-01, RND-02, RND-03, RND-04, RND-05, RND-06, RND-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The trigger source dropdown for each voice shows four options: Pad / Joystick / Random Free / Random Hold — and existing saved presets using the old "Random" option load as "Random Free" without breaking
  2. In Random Free mode, gates fire continuously; in Random Hold mode, gates fire only while the pad is physically held down — verifiable by pressing and releasing the touchplate
  3. The Population knob (1–64) limits how many gate slots are generated per bar; the Probability knob (0–100%) sets the chance each slot actually fires — both are automatable and save with the preset
  4. Subdivision 1/64 is available in the random subdivision selector alongside 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32
  5. A single Gate Length knob (0–100% of subdivision) controls note hold duration for both Random and Arpeggiator sources; the knob is present in the UI and automatable
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 21: Left Joystick Modulation Expansion
**Goal**: The left joystick X and Y axes can be pointed at LFO frequency, phase, level, or arp gate length in addition to the existing CC74/CC71 filter targets, so players can modulate expressively from the gamepad without touching the mouse
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Requirements**: LJOY-01, LJOY-02, LJOY-03, LJOY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The Left Joystick X dropdown offers at least six target options including Filter Cutoff (CC74), LFO-X Frequency, LFO-X Phase, LFO-X Level, and Gate Length; the Left Joystick Y dropdown offers the equivalent Y-axis variants
  2. Selecting LFO-X Frequency as the Left Joystick X target and moving the left stick left-right produces audible LFO rate changes — confirmed by LFO waveform speed changing in the UI
  3. When LFO Sync mode is active, selecting LFO Frequency as the stick target has no effect on LFO rate — the stick moves without changing speed
  4. Switching a stick target from CC74 to any LFO parameter stops CC74 from being emitted — no leftover CC messages on the old target after a target change
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 22: LFO Recording
**Goal**: Players can capture one loop cycle of live LFO output into the LFO and replay it in perfect sync with the looper — enabling repeatable LFO shapes from live performance without programming — while Distort stays adjustable during playback
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: LFOREC-01, LFOREC-02, LFOREC-03, LFOREC-04, LFOREC-05, LFOREC-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An Arm button appears next to the LFO Sync button; pressing it arms recording — the LFO does not begin capturing until the looper starts its next record cycle
  2. After arming and starting a looper record cycle, LFO output is captured for exactly one loop length; recording stops automatically and the LFO enters playback mode replaying the captured shape in sync with the looper
  3. During LFO playback mode, the Shape, Freq, Phase, and Level controls are visually grayed out and non-interactive; the Distort slider remains fully adjustable and audibly changes the playback output
  4. Pressing the Clear button returns the LFO to normal (unarmed) mode — all grayed-out controls become interactive again and the LFO resumes real-time generation
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 23: Arpeggiator
**Goal**: Players can arpeggiate the current four-voice chord at a selected rate and order, synchronized to the DAW or looper, so the plugin produces melodic patterns without external MIDI tools
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Requirements**: ARP-01, ARP-02, ARP-03, ARP-04, ARP-05, ARP-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Enabling the arpeggiator causes the four chord voices to play as a sequence of individual notes at the selected Rate (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32) and Order (Up, Down, Up-Down, Random) — confirmed in DAW MIDI monitor
  2. The arpeggiator steps fire on the active MIDI channel routing (Single Channel or Multi-Channel) — no notes appear on unintended channels
  3. With DAW sync active, turning the arp on arms it and stepping begins exactly on the next bar boundary — no early or late first note
  4. Turning the arp off stops all notes immediately and the step counter resets to 0 — the next arp-on starts from the first voice
  5. Arp note durations follow the unified Gate Length parameter — setting Gate Length to 50% causes each arp note to hold for half its subdivision slot
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 24: Gamepad Option Mode 1
**Goal**: Option Mode 1 on the gamepad provides one-handed arp and random trigger control during live performance — Circle toggles arp, Triangle steps arp rate, Square steps arp order, X toggles RND Sync — and R3 alone no longer triggers MIDI Panic
**Depends on**: Phase 19, Phase 23
**Requirements**: OPT1-01, OPT1-02, OPT1-03, OPT1-04, OPT1-05, OPT1-06, OPT1-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. In Option Mode 1, pressing Circle toggles the arp on/off — turning it on triggers a looper reset to beat 0 and starts playback (or arms if DAW sync is active); the arp UI reflects the state change
  2. In Option Mode 1, pressing Triangle once steps the Arp Rate up (1/4 → 1/8 → 1/16 → 1/32 → wraps); pressing it twice quickly steps it down — the Rate dropdown in the UI updates visually
  3. In Option Mode 1, pressing Square steps Arp Order with the same two-press architecture; pressing X toggles RND Sync — the RND Sync state in the UI reflects the change
  4. Holding any pad button (R1/R2/L1/L2) and pressing R3 toggles Sub Oct for that voice in any mode — the Sub Oct toggle in the UI updates visually
  5. Pressing R3 alone no longer sends MIDI Panic — panic is only accessible via the UI Panic button; Option Mode 2 (D-pad Program Change scrolling) continues to work unchanged
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 25: Distribution
**Goal**: v1.5 is publicly released on GitHub and backed up locally
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: DIST-03, DIST-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A GitHub release tagged `v1.5` exists with the installer binary attached and release notes describing the new routing, sub octave, arp, LFO recording, and bug fix features
  2. A full copy of the built plugin and installer is present on the Desktop backup location — confirmed by directory listing
  3. The installer runs successfully on a clean machine without pre-installed MSVC redistributables (static CRT confirmed)
**Plans**: TBD
