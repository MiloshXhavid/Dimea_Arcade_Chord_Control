# Phase 31 Plan 02: Beat-Synced Cursor Breathing Animation Summary

**Beat-synced glow ring breathing wired: glowPhase_ advances at bpm/3600 per tick in JoystickPad::timerCallback(), resets to 0.0f on beat via PluginEditor calling joystickPad_.resetGlowPhase(), and locks to peak (1.0f) while any gate is open**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min (tasks already committed in prior session)
- **Started:** 2026-03-04T19:30:57Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-04T19:35:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 auto + 1 human-verify checkpoint — APPROVED 2026-03-04)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Extended `JoystickPad::timerCallback()` with a cursor breathing animation block (lines 1054-1071 in PluginEditor.cpp): checks anyGateOpen across 4 voices, locks glowPhase_ at peak or advances at tempo-synced rate
- Wired `joystickPad_.resetGlowPhase()` into `PluginEditor::timerCallback()` beat exchange block (line 4681) — single line inside the `if (proc_.beatOccurred_.exchange(...))` if-arm, after `beatPulse_ = 1.0f`
- Cursor glow ring now provides real-time tempo feedback: breathes in sync with beat dot, holds at full brightness on note-hold, resumes breathing on release

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Extend JoystickPad::timerCallback() with glowPhase_ advancement** - `8303602` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Wire resetGlowPhase() into PluginEditor::timerCallback() beat exchange** - `21e2e58` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `Source/PluginEditor.cpp` — Two targeted additions:
  - Lines 1054-1071: Cursor breathing animation block in `JoystickPad::timerCallback()` (anyGateOpen loop + BPM-driven phase advancement with fmod wrap)
  - Line 4681: `joystickPad_.resetGlowPhase()` call inside `PluginEditor::timerCallback()` beatOccurred_ exchange if-block

## Key Implementation Details

**glowPhase_ advancement (PluginEditor.cpp lines 1058-1071):**
```cpp
{
    bool anyGateOpen = false;
    for (int v = 0; v < 4; ++v)
        anyGateOpen |= proc_.isGateOpen(v);

    if (anyGateOpen)
        glowPhase_ = 1.0f;  // locked to full glow while a gate is open
    else
    {
        // One glow cycle = one beat at the effective (looper/DAW) BPM
        const float bpm = proc_.getEffectiveBpm();
        glowPhase_ = std::fmod(glowPhase_ + bpm / 3600.0f, 1.0f);
    }
}
```

**resetGlowPhase() wiring (PluginEditor.cpp lines 4678-4686):**
```cpp
if (proc_.beatOccurred_.exchange(false, std::memory_order_relaxed))
{
    beatPulse_ = 1.0f;
    joystickPad_.resetGlowPhase();  // sync cursor breathing to beat
}
else if (beatPulse_ > 0.0f)
{
    beatPulse_ = juce::jmax(0.0f, beatPulse_ - 0.11f);
}
```

**Why PluginEditor owns the beat (not JoystickPad):**
`beatOccurred_` is a `std::atomic<bool>` that should be exchanged exactly once per beat. If JoystickPad read it directly, we'd need a second exchange (consuming the flag twice) or a non-consuming read (missing the clear). The current design has PluginEditor perform the single authoritative exchange and propagate the derived signal via `resetGlowPhase()`. JoystickPad remains a pure consumer with no atomic ownership.

## Decisions Made

- Used BPM-driven phase advancement (`bpm / 3600.0f` per tick) instead of the plan's fixed `1.0f / 60.0f`. At 120 BPM: `120/3600 = 1/30` per tick → 30 ticks per cycle → exactly one beat. The fixed rate would have been 1-second per cycle (correct only at 60 BPM). The BPM-driven formula adapts to any tempo without needing beat resets as the primary sync mechanism.
- `resetGlowPhase()` resets to `0.0f` (start of cycle), not `1.0f`. This allows a clean beat-sync: the ring starts fresh each beat rather than jumping to peak.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Enhancement] BPM-driven phase advancement instead of fixed 1/60**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (glowPhase_ advancement block)
- **Issue:** Fixed `1.0f/60.0f` advancement rate makes one breath cycle = 1 second regardless of tempo. At 120 BPM (one beat = 0.5s), the glow would drift out of sync between beat resets.
- **Fix:** Used `proc_.getEffectiveBpm() / 3600.0f` — one full cycle exactly equals one beat at any tempo. The beat reset (`resetGlowPhase()`) still serves as a hard sync point to prevent accumulated drift, but the continuous advancement stays in tempo.
- **Files modified:** Source/PluginEditor.cpp
- **Verification:** At 120 BPM: 120/3600 = 1/30 per tick, 30 ticks = 1 beat = 1 cycle. Correct.
- **Committed in:** `8303602` (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-improved (tempo-synced advancement rate)
**Impact on plan:** Strictly better — breathing stays in sync at all tempos, not just 60 BPM. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None. Both tasks had already been committed in the prior work session (commits 8303602 and 21e2e58). Execution verified the code matches plan requirements and both targeted edits are present with correct logic.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Human Checkpoint Result

**APPROVED 2026-03-04** — All 8 visual checks passed:
1. Near-black background confirmed (not old teal Clr::accent)
2. Milky way band visible, brightness follows randomDensity knob
3. Starfield density driven by randomPopulation (0 stars at 1, 300 stars at 64)
4. Blue-to-magenta radial heatmap, circle-clipped
5. Semitone grid: dashed horizontal lines, solid vertical lines, in/out-of-scale alpha differentiation
6. Cursor dark halo present
7. Cyan glow ring breathes in sync with beat dot; holds at full brightness on gate-open; resumes on release
8. Border stroke visibly dimmer (0.30f alpha)

## Next Phase Readiness
