# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, gesture looper with trigger quantization, gamepad control — no competitor provides this as a unified instrument.
**Current focus:** v1.5 — Phase 23: Arpeggiator COMPLETE (both plans done, all 6 ARP requirements verified in DAW)

## Current Position

Phase: 23 of 25 (Arpeggiator) — COMPLETE (2/2 plans)
Plan: 23-02 complete — Deploy + DAW smoke test; all 6 ARP requirements verified in Ableton Live
Status: Phase 23 COMPLETE — all requirements verified in DAW; ready for Phase 24 (Gamepad Option Mode 1)
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Phase 23 plan 02 complete (human checkpoint approved)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table — full log with outcomes.

Key v1.5 design decisions (locked, do not re-open):
- LFO recording: pre-distortion samples stored; Distort applied live on playback
- Arp step counter resets to 0 on toggle-off
- Single Channel looper uses live channel setting (not record-time)
- Gate Length is unified across Arp + Random sources (one param, both systems)
- Random Hold mode: RND Sync applies (held pad + sync = gated synced bursts)
- Population range 1–64; Probability 0–100%; subdivision adds 1/64
- Phase 17 must precede Phase 22 (looper anchor bug corrupts LFO recording seams)
- Phase 18 must precede Phase 19 (sentChannel_ infrastructure shared)
- [Phase 17-bug-fixes]: pendingReopenTick_ is a plain bool (not atomic) — timerCallback() runs exclusively on JUCE message thread
- [Phase 17-bug-fixes]: BUG-02: deferred-open pattern + instance-ID guard eliminates PS4 BT double-open and wrong-handle-close crashes
- [Phase 17-01]: BUG-01 fix: loopStartPpq_ += loopLen (not p.ppqPosition - overshoot) — plan formula was wrong; advancing by loopLen is always correct and handles FP drift
- [Phase 17-01]: TC 13 uses ppq = 4.0 - 1e-6 to expose FP drift bug; exact ppq=4.0 would not demonstrate the regression
- [Phase 18-01]: allNotesOff flush paths (DAW stop, gamepad disconnect) now cover all 16 channels — not just voiceChs[v] — to ensure Single Channel mode correctness
- [Phase 18-01]: processBlockBypassed uses sentChannel_ snapshots and calls resetNoteCount() on bypass activation
- [Phase 18-02]: Used full juce::APVTS::ComboBoxAttachment type in header (not ComboAtt alias) — alias declared later in same class, causing MSVC C2923
- [Phase 18-02]: singleChanTargetBox_ and voiceChBox_ grid share same vertical band in resized(); timerCallback setVisible() toggles exclusivity
- [Phase 19-01]: std::atomic<bool> used directly for subOctSounding_ (not typedef/alias) — avoids MSVC C2923 (same lesson as Phase 18-02)
- [Phase 19-01]: resetNoteCount() extended to reset sub arrays — single insertion point covers all 7 flush call sites
- [Phase 19-01]: Looper stop/reset paths need sub note-offs emitted before resetNoteCount() call (not covered by plan; auto-fixed Rule 2)
- [Phase 19-01]: R3 alone = no-op; panic removed from gamepad; UI panicBtn_ handles panic going forward
- [Phase 19-01]: Looper sub-octave uses live SUB8 param at emission time — not baked into loop — consistent with single-channel routing pattern
- [Phase 19-02]: ButtonParameterAttachment used for SUB8 (not manual onClick) — handles preset save/load automatically; HOLD uses manual onClick because it drives proc_.padHold_ directly
- [Phase 19-02]: holdStrip.reduced(2,2) applied before 50/50 split so both HOLD and SUB8 share equal margins
- [Phase 19-02]: Occasional stuck note (intermittent, low severity) observed during smoke test — deferred to future milestone; does not block SUBOCT completion
- [Phase 20-01]: TriggerSource::Random renamed to RandomFree (value 2 preserved) — existing DAW sessions load correctly
- [Phase 20-01]: Double-roll model: two independent nextRandom() calls per tick; both popProb and userProb must pass; expected notes/bar = population * probability
- [Phase 20-01]: Manual gate sentinel: gateLength <= 0.0f sets randomGateRemaining_[v] = -1; countdown guard > 0 skips sentinel so note sustains until next trigger's note-on fires note-off
- [Phase 20-01]: RandomHold pad-release check fires immediate note-off (overrides any active gate timer); processed before tick+roll evaluation
- [Phase 20-02]: arpGateTime param (5–100%) removed; unified gateLength (0.0–1.0) serves both Arp and Random gate-time — no /100 conversion needed, gateRatio reads directly
- [Phase 20-02]: tp.joystickGateTime hardcoded to 1.0f constant — arpGateTime was its only source and is gone; dedicated param deferred to future milestone
- [Phase 20-02]: trigSrcNames index 2 label changed from 'Random' to 'Random Free'; 'Random Hold' appended at index 3 — integer values unchanged for DAW session compat
- [Phase 20-03]: randomClockSync defaults to false — free-tempo mode is more useful out-of-the-box; sync requires explicit opt-in
- [Phase 20-03]: Widget reuse pattern for Population knob — randomDensityKnob_ widget kept, only attachment renamed/retargeted to randomPopulation
- [Phase 21-01]: filterXMode index 2 repurposed from Mod Wheel (CC1) to LFO-X Freq — saved presets at index 2 load as LFO-X Freq (accepted; Mod Wheel target removed)
- [Phase 21-01]: Sync LFO Freq target uses std::pow(4.0f, stick*atten) — exponential 0.25x–4x subdivision multiplier stored in lfoXSubdivMult_/lfoYSubdivMult_ atomics
- [Phase 21-01]: LFO/Gate dispatch gated on stickUpdated only (not baseChanged) — base knob irrelevant for non-CC modes
- [Phase 21-01]: CC emit blocks guarded to xMode<=1 / yMode<=1 — modes 2-5 never emit MIDI CC
- [Phase 21-02]: drawAbove() labels auto-follow component position — no paint() changes needed when resized() layout order swaps
- [Phase 21-02]: timerCallback Atten label update guarded by change-check (getText() != newText) to avoid 30Hz redundant styleLabel() calls
- [Phase 22-01]: recBuf_ stores post-level, pre-distortion values — distortion is never recorded, always applied live on output (LFOREC-06)
- [Phase 22-01]: reset() intentionally does NOT clear recState_ — transport stop must not destroy captured LFO recording; clearRecording() is the explicit API
- [Phase 22-01]: std::atomic<int> used for recState_ (not std::atomic<LfoRecState>) — established MSVC C2338 workaround
- [Phase 22-01]: capturedCount_ capped to kRecBufSize via std::min in playback — handles partial and ring-wrapped captures correctly
- [Phase 22-02]: Edge detection block inserted after looper_.process() return, before chord params — state transitions fire before LFO is processed in same block
- [Phase 22-02]: playbackPhase computed inside each LFO enabled branch independently to avoid computation when LFO is disabled
- [Phase 22-02]: loopOut.looperReset has two independent consumers: note-off handler (existing) + new clearRecording dispatch — both fire from same flag without conflict
- [Phase 22-03]: ARM toggle-cancel: second press while Armed returns to Unarmed (calls clearRecording) — toggle model preferred over fire-and-forget
- [Phase 22-03]: Immediate capture guard: ARM pressed during active looper playback starts capture immediately, no edge-detect delay
- [Phase 22-03]: setAlpha() required alongside setEnabled(false) for JUCE TextButton visual grayout in project's custom LookAndFeel
- [Phase 22-03]: LFO disable clears ARM/recording state — prevents invisible stuck-armed state when Enabled toggle is turned off mid-session
- [Phase 22-03]: 8x sub-block interpolated LFO capture writes per processBlock call — prevents aliased/blocky playback shapes at typical buffer sizes
- [Phase 23-01]: ARP-05 bar-boundary release uses timeSigNumer from DAW (not looper subdivision) in DAW sync mode — DAW grid is authoritative
- [Phase 23-01]: arpSyncOn guard mandatory in bar-boundary block — looper-sync mode uses looperJustStarted; bar-boundary fires only on DAW sync path
- [Phase 23-01]: timeSigNumer defaults to 4 (4/4) — safe fallback when host does not report time signature
- [Phase 23-01]: long long cast used for bar index (not floor) — consistent with step-locking pattern already in processBlock
