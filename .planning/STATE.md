# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, gesture looper with trigger quantization, gamepad control — no competitor provides this as a unified instrument.
**Current focus:** v1.5 — Phase 20: RND Trigger Extensions

## Current Position

Phase: 20 of 25 (RND Trigger Extensions) — In progress
Plan: 1 of 3 in Phase 20 complete
Status: Plan 20-01 complete — TriggerSystem.h/cpp backend updated with RandomHold, double-roll, sentinel, 1/64
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Plan 20-01 executed; TriggerSystem backend ready; Plan 20-02 (PluginProcessor) next

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 39 (v1.0: 17, v1.3: 11, v1.4: 9, v1.5: 8 [Phase 17 complete + 18-01 + 18-02 + 18-03 + 19-01 + 19-02 + 20-01])
- Average duration: not tracked per plan
- Total execution time: not tracked

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table — full log with outcomes.

Key v1.5 design decisions (locked, do not re-open):
- LFO recording: pre-distortion samples stored; Distort applied live on playback
- Arp step counter resets to 0 on toggle-off
- Single Channel looper uses live channel setting (not record-time)
- Gate Length is unified across Arp + Random sources (one param, both systems)
- Random Hold mode: RND Sync applies (held pad + sync = gated synced bursts)
- Population range 1–64; Probability 0–100%; subdivision adds 1/64
- Phase 17 must precede Phase 22 (looper anchor bug corrupts LFO recording seams)
- Phase 18 must precede Phase 19 (sentChannel_ infrastructure shared)
- [Phase 17-bug-fixes]: pendingReopenTick_ is a plain bool (not atomic) — timerCallback() runs exclusively on JUCE message thread
- [Phase 17-bug-fixes]: BUG-02: deferred-open pattern + instance-ID guard eliminates PS4 BT double-open and wrong-handle-close crashes
- [Phase 17-01]: BUG-01 fix: loopStartPpq_ += loopLen (not p.ppqPosition - overshoot) — plan formula was wrong; advancing by loopLen is always correct and handles FP drift
- [Phase 17-01]: TC 13 uses ppq = 4.0 - 1e-6 to expose FP drift bug; exact ppq=4.0 would not demonstrate the regression
- [Phase 18-01]: allNotesOff flush paths (DAW stop, gamepad disconnect) now cover all 16 channels — not just voiceChs[v] — to ensure Single Channel mode correctness
- [Phase 18-01]: processBlockBypassed uses sentChannel_ snapshots and calls resetNoteCount() on bypass activation
- [Phase 18-02]: Used full juce::APVTS::ComboBoxAttachment type in header (not ComboAtt alias) — alias declared later in same class, causing MSVC C2923
- [Phase 18-02]: singleChanTargetBox_ and voiceChBox_ grid share same vertical band in resized(); timerCallback setVisible() toggles exclusivity
- [Phase 19-01]: std::atomic<bool> used directly for subOctSounding_ (not typedef/alias) — avoids MSVC C2923 (same lesson as Phase 18-02)
- [Phase 19-01]: resetNoteCount() extended to reset sub arrays — single insertion point covers all 7 flush call sites
- [Phase 19-01]: Looper stop/reset paths need sub note-offs emitted before resetNoteCount() call (not covered by plan; auto-fixed Rule 2)
- [Phase 19-01]: R3 alone = no-op; panic removed from gamepad; UI panicBtn_ handles panic going forward
- [Phase 19-01]: Looper sub-octave uses live SUB8 param at emission time — not baked into loop — consistent with single-channel routing pattern
- [Phase 19-02]: ButtonParameterAttachment used for SUB8 (not manual onClick) — handles preset save/load automatically; HOLD uses manual onClick because it drives proc_.padHold_ directly
- [Phase 19-02]: holdStrip.reduced(2,2) applied before 50/50 split so both HOLD and SUB8 share equal margins
- [Phase 19-02]: Occasional stuck note (intermittent, low severity) observed during smoke test — deferred to future milestone; does not block SUBOCT completion
- [Phase 20-01]: TriggerSource::Random renamed to RandomFree (value 2 preserved) — existing DAW sessions load correctly
- [Phase 20-01]: Double-roll model: two independent nextRandom() calls per tick; both popProb and userProb must pass; expected notes/bar = population * probability
- [Phase 20-01]: Manual gate sentinel: gateLength <= 0.0f sets randomGateRemaining_[v] = -1; countdown guard > 0 skips sentinel so note sustains until next trigger's note-on fires note-off
- [Phase 20-01]: RandomHold pad-release check fires immediate note-off (overrides any active gate timer); processed before tick+roll evaluation

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
