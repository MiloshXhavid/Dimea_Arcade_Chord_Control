# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, gesture looper with trigger quantization, gamepad control — no competitor provides this as a unified instrument.
**Current focus:** v1.4 LFO + Clock — Phase 13 Plan 01 complete

## Current Position

Phase: 13 of 15 (processBlock + APVTS integration)
Plan: 1 of 1 (Plan 01 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — Phase 13 Plan 01 complete (LfoEngine wired into processBlock, 16 APVTS params, 15/15 LfoEngine tests pass)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table — full log with outcomes.

Recent decisions affecting v1.4:
- LFO output applied as additive offset inside buildChordParams() local scope — never written to joystickX/Y atomics (prevents looper conflict)
- S&H/Random waveforms use project LCG (`seed * 1664525u + 1013904223u`), not std::rand() — audio-thread safe on MSVC
- Sync mode derives phase from ppqPos when DAW is playing; uses sample counter only when DAW is stopped — prevents drift
- No second timer for LFO UI — all display reads in existing 30 Hz timerCallback
- LfoEngine is fully standalone (no JUCE/APVTS/LooperEngine headers) — tested in isolation before wiring into processBlock
- nextLcg() maps via static_cast<int32_t>(rng_) / 0x7FFFFFFF for bipolar [-1,+1] output (differs from TriggerSystem::nextRandom() which uses rng_>>1 for unipolar [0,1))
- evaluateWaveform() declared non-const (not const + const_cast) — Random waveform calls nextLcg() which mutates rng_
- Triangle test values match actual implementation (single-peak: trough at phi=0, peak at phi=0.5) — plan spec described a double-frequency shape that does not match LfoEngine.cpp formula
- LfoEngine.cpp requires #include <algorithm> for std::min; JUCE headers masked this in plugin build, standalone test build exposed it (auto-fixed)
- Phase 13: chordP declared non-const so LFO can write additive offset to joystickX/Y before pitch compute
- Phase 13: Skew factor 0.2306f hard-coded for log-scale rate range [0.01,20] Hz midpoint=1Hz — JUCE 8.0.4 lacks getSkewFactorFromMidPoint()
- Phase 13: Joystick-source voice retriggering with LFO active is intentional — post-LFO chordP drives TriggerSystem deltaX/deltaY

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- LFO UI layout decision needed before Phase 14 planning: where do two LFO panels fit in the space-constrained editor? Side panel vs collapsible vs tab. Decide at plan-phase 14 time.
