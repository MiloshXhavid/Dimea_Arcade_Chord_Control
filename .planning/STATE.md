# Project State

## Project Reference

**ChordJoystick** — XY joystick → 4-voice chord MIDI VST3, gamepad + looper, paid Windows release.

Core value: Continuous harmonic navigation via joystick with per-voice sample-and-hold gates — no competitor provides this.

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 01 of 7 — Build Foundation and JUCE Version Lock
- **Plan:** 01-01 (not started)
- **Status:** pending

## Progress

```
Phase 01 [░░░░░░░░░░]   Build Foundation
Phase 02 [░░░░░░░░░░]   Engine Validation
Phase 03 [░░░░░░░░░░]   Core MIDI Output
Phase 04 [░░░░░░░░░░]   Trigger Sources
Phase 05 [░░░░░░░░░░]   Looper Hardening
Phase 06 [░░░░░░░░░░]   SDL2 Gamepad
Phase 07 [░░░░░░░░░░]   Distribution

Overall: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/7 phases complete)
```

## What's Been Built

- All 14 source files written (full implementation — not yet compiled or tested):
  - ScaleQuantizer, ChordEngine, TriggerSystem, LooperEngine, GamepadInput
  - PluginProcessor, PluginEditor
- APVTS parameter layout (all 40+ params) previously committed
- Scale quantization implementation committed in prior session
- PROJECT.md with validated requirements
- Full research completed (.planning/research/)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| JUCE 8 + CMake FetchContent | Locked — pin to 8.0.4, not origin/master (critical fix needed) |
| SDL2 2.30.9 static | Locked — already correctly configured |
| VST3 only (Windows) | Locked — v1 scope |
| 4 voices on MIDI channels 1-4 | Default routing, user-configurable per voice |
| Sample-and-hold pitch model | Pitch locked at trigger moment, not continuous |
| Quantize ties → down | Deterministic behavior at equidistance |
| Lock-free LooperEngine | Required before DAW testing — current mutex impl is unsafe |

## Known Issues (Must Fix Before Shipping)

1. **JUCE pinned to `origin/master`** — Non-reproducible builds. Fix in Phase 01-01.
2. **std::mutex in LooperEngine processBlock** — Blocks audio thread. Fix in Phase 05.
3. **Filter CC (CC71/CC74) emitted unconditionally** — Floods synth at ~175 msgs/sec when no gamepad. Fix in Phase 06.
4. **releaseResources() is empty** — Stuck notes on transport stop. Fix in Phase 03.
5. **SDL_Init/SDL_Quit per instance** — Multi-instance race condition. Fix in Phase 06.

## Pending Todos

(none)

## Blockers / Concerns

- Build not yet verified — must compile before any other work
- SDL2 testing: confirm SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER works without video subsystem in DAW
- Ableton MIDI routing: empirical testing required (no definitive documentation)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-22
Stopped at: new-project paused at step 7/9 (requirements); full implementation written but uncompiled
Resumed: 2026-02-22 — ROADMAP.md and STATE.md reconstructed; ready to execute Phase 01
Resume file: none
