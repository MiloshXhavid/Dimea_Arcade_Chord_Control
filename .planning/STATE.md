# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, gesture looper with trigger quantization, gamepad control — no competitor provides this as a unified instrument.
**Current focus:** v1.6 — Phase 27 complete, ready for Phase 28 or 29

## Current Position

Phase: 27 (complete — 1/1 plans done)
Plan: 01 (complete)
Status: Phase 27 complete — advancing to Phase 28 or 29
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Phase 27 plan 01 executed: triplet subdivisions added + reordered to interleaved tempo order

```
v1.0 MVP    [██████████] SHIPPED 2026-02-23
v1.3 Polish [██████████] SHIPPED 2026-02-25
v1.4 LFO    [██████████] SHIPPED 2026-02-26
v1.5 Routing+Expression [██████████] SHIPPED 2026-03-02
v1.6 Triplets & Fixes   [████      ] 2/5 phases complete
```

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.5 ended at Phase 25; v1.6 starts at Phase 26
- v1.6 roadmap: 5 phases (26-30), 16 requirements (14 feature + 2 distribution)

### Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 26 | Defaults and Bug Fix | DEF-01..04, BUG-03 | Complete |
| 27 | Triplet Subdivisions | TRIP-01, TRIP-02 | Complete |
| 28 | Random Free Redesign | RND-08, RND-09, RND-10 | Not started |
| 29 | Looper Perimeter Bar | LOOP-01..04 | Not started |
| 30 | Distribution | DIST-05, DIST-06 | Not started |

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table — full log with outcomes.

Key v1.6 design decisions (locked):
- noteCount_ `else = 0` clamp confirmed as stuck-notes root cause — removed from all 13 note-off paths (Phase 26)
- APVTS defaults set only in createParameterLayout() fourth argument — single source of truth (Phase 26)
- fifthOctave default 3→4; scalePreset default 0→1 (Major→NaturalMinor) confirmed correct (Phase 26)
- Random Free + RND SYNC OFF = truly random intervals (Poisson/random, no subdivision grid)
- Random Free + RND SYNC ON + DAW Sync OFF = internal free-tempo clock grid
- Random Free + DAW Sync ON = DAW beat grid (existing behavior, clarified)
- Triplet subdivisions target: random trigger subdivisions AND quantize subdivisions (not LFO sync — deferred to v2 as LFO-EXT-02)
- Looper perimeter bar: clockwise, starts/ends at label top-left, 30 Hz via existing timerCallback
- DIST-05 and DIST-06 minted for v1.6 distribution phase (continuing DIST-01..04 sequence)
- Phase 27 depends on Phase 26 (APVTS enum changes must land before triplet logic) — Phase 27 now complete
- Phase 28 depends on Phase 27 (triplet subdivision values must exist in enum before redesign reads them) — Phase 27 now complete
- Triplet subdivisions interleaved with straight counterparts in all selectors (RandomSubdiv enum, APVTS choices, quantizeSubdivToGridSize, PluginEditor ComboBoxes) — no preset backward compatibility maintained (user accepted)
- Phase 29 depends on Phase 26 (independent of 27/28, but must start from stable base) — Phase 26 now complete
- Phase 30 depends on Phase 29 (last feature phase; distribution always last)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-03
Stopped at: Phase 27 plan 01 complete — triplet subdivisions added + reordered to interleaved tempo order
Next step: /gsd:plan-phase 28 or /gsd:plan-phase 29
