# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, gesture looper with trigger quantization, gamepad control — no competitor provides this as a unified instrument.
**Current focus:** v1.9 — Planning next milestone (Phases 38-43)

## Current Position

Milestone v1.8 complete — all 5 phases (34, 35, 36, 37, 44), 7 plans shipped.
Status: v1.8 archived. Next: /gsd:new-milestone for v1.9 Living Interface.
Last activity: 2026-03-07 — v1.8 milestone completion archived

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.5 ended at Phase 25; v1.6 starts at Phase 26
- v1.6 roadmap: 5 phases (26-30), 16 requirements (14 feature + 2 distribution)

### Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 26 | Defaults and Bug Fix | DEF-01..04, BUG-03 | Complete |
| 27 | Triplet Subdivisions | TRIP-01, TRIP-02 | Complete |
| 28 | Random Free Redesign | RND-08, RND-09, RND-10 | Complete |
| 29 | Looper Perimeter Bar | LOOP-01..04 | Complete |
| 30 | Distribution | DIST-05, DIST-06 | In Progress (1/2) |

### Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table — full log with outcomes.

Key v1.6 design decisions (locked):
- noteCount_ `else = 0` clamp confirmed as stuck-notes root cause — removed from all 13 note-off paths (Phase 26)
- APVTS defaults set only in createParameterLayout() fourth argument — single source of truth (Phase 26)
- fifthOctave default 3→4; scalePreset default 0→1 (Major→NaturalMinor) confirmed correct (Phase 26)
- Random Free + RND SYNC OFF = truly random intervals (Poisson/random, no subdivision grid)
- Random Free + RND SYNC ON + DAW Sync OFF = internal free-tempo clock grid
- Random Free + DAW Sync ON = DAW beat grid (existing behavior, clarified)
- Triplet subdivisions target: random trigger subdivisions AND quantize subdivisions (not LFO sync — deferred to v2 as LFO-EXT-02)
- Looper perimeter bar: clockwise, starts/ends at label top-left, 30 Hz via existing timerCallback (IMPLEMENTED Phase 29)
- perimPoint lambda uses fmod+conditional add for negative-distance wraparound — tail before position 0 wraps correctly without corner special-casing
- excludeClipRegion (not reduceClipRegion) for label protection — subtracts label zone so bar passes alongside characters without covering them
- Ghost ring: 1px / gateOff.brighter(0.3f) when looper stopped; animated tail+head: 40px tail @ 0.28 alpha + 12px head @ full alpha (Phase 29)
- DIST-05 and DIST-06 minted for v1.6 distribution phase (continuing DIST-01..04 sequence)
- Phase 27 depends on Phase 26 (APVTS enum changes must land before triplet logic) — Phase 27 now complete
- Phase 28 depends on Phase 27 (triplet subdivision values must exist in enum before redesign reads them) — Phase 28 now complete
- randomProbability (0-1.0) drives Poisson rate: effProb * 64 events/bar — 0=silence, 1=maximum density (REDESIGNED 2026-03-03)
- randomPopulation is upward-only modulator (SYNC OFF: effProb = prob*(1+rand*normPop)) or subdivision pool radius (SYNC ON: radius = floor(normPop*7), pool expands both directions) (REDESIGNED 2026-03-03)
- Burst mechanics removed entirely — each trigger event fires exactly 1 note (REDESIGNED 2026-03-03)
- Three-branch sync matrix: !randomClockSync=Poisson, isDawPlaying+ppq=DAW-grid, else=internal-counter
- Triplet subdivisions interleaved with straight counterparts in all selectors (RandomSubdiv enum, APVTS choices, quantizeSubdivToGridSize, PluginEditor ComboBoxes) — no preset backward compatibility maintained (user accepted)
- Phase 29 depends on Phase 26 (independent of 27/28, but must start from stable base) — Phase 26 now complete
- Phase 30 depends on Phase 29 (last feature phase; distribution always last)
- VST3 bundle source path is Chord Joystick Control (BETA).vst3 — PRODUCT_NAME in CMakeLists.txt is "Chord Joystick Control (BETA)"; DestDir installs to DIMEA CHORD JOYSTICK MK2.vst3 (Phase 30, plan 01)
- [Phase 31]: Milky way uses 3-layer Gaussian (outer/mid/core) baked in resized() for zero per-frame allocation
- [Phase 31]: Semitone grid replaces area-count grid: joystickXAtten/YAtten now mean exact semitone count with in/out-of-scale alpha differentiation
- [Phase 31 plan 02]: BPM-driven glow phase advancement (bpm/3600 per tick) — one full cycle = one beat at any tempo; beat reset via resetGlowPhase() prevents drift
- [Phase 31 plan 02]: Beat ownership rule — PluginEditor owns beatOccurred_ exchange, notifies JoystickPad via resetGlowPhase() only; JoystickPad never reads beatOccurred_
- [Phase 33.1]: kDamping 0.90 (near-critical) chosen for spring return — no overshoot, ~150ms settle
- [Phase 33.1]: LFO rate stick modulation in normalized log space (NormalisableRange skew=0.35, +/-0.5 offset) for perceptual symmetry
- [Phase 33.1]: INV attachment swap guarded by prevInvState_ — fires once on toggle, not every 30Hz timer tick
- [Phase 33.1]: Piano black key two-pass hit test — kBlackNotes[] checked first, then kWhiteNotes[]
- [Phase 33.1]: Battery icon redesigned as 3 vertical stripe blocks; GamepadInput.cpp unchanged (paint-only fix)
- [Phase 33]: Plugin release tag convention: v1.7 (no patch) pushed to plugin remote only; gh release create --latest supersedes v1.6 as Latest
- [Phase 33]: DIST-06 (v1.6 desktop backup) marked skipped — superseded by DIST-08 (v1.7 backup)
- [Phase 34]: Cross-LFO case 8 reads curIdx from target LFO APVTS subdiv param (no MOD FIX offset) — modulates around current knob position
- [Phase 34]: subdivMult reset guards extended with cross-axis conditions: lfoXSubdivMult_ skips reset when yMode==8; lfoYSubdivMult_ skips reset when xMode==8
- [Phase 44]: IS_MIDI_EFFECT FALSE in CMakeLists required — JUCE VST3 wrapper ignores C++ isMidiEffect() for bus configuration
- [Phase 44]: Output bus enabled (true) in BusesProperties — instrument slot visibility in FL Studio, Cakewalk, Logic requires active output bus
- [Phase 44]: .withInput() removed entirely — instruments don't consume audio input; inactive input bus would confuse host routing
- [Phase 44]: isBusesLayoutSupported accepts numOut=0 — DAWs may probe with zero outputs during instrument discovery
- [Phase 37]: Line 773 (internalBeat_=0.0) removed — fmod at line 758 already absorbs overshoot; sentinel was always wrong for free-running mode
- [Phase 38-quick-fixes-rec-lane-undo]: looperJoyActive/gpXs/gpYs re-read inline at looper write-back site (processBlock) because buildChordParams() is a separate function — no shared scope
- [Phase 38-quick-fixes-rec-lane-undo]: Lane-clear pending flags use same exchange pattern as deleteRequest_/resetRequest_ at top of LooperEngine::process()

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Session Continuity
