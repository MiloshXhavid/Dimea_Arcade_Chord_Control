# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, gesture looper, gamepad control — no competitor provides this as a unified instrument.
**Current focus:** v1.0 shipped — planning next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — Milestone v1.1 started

  Phase 01 [██████████]   Build Foundation    COMPLETE
  Phase 02 [██████████]   Engine Validation   COMPLETE
  Phase 03 [██████████]   Core MIDI Output    COMPLETE
  Phase 04 [██████████]   Trigger Sources     COMPLETE

```

## What Was Shipped (v1.0)

- 7 phases, 17 plans, ~3,966 C++ LOC
- 26 Catch2 tests passing
- pluginval strictness 5: 19/19 suites passed
- `installer/Output/DimaChordJoystick-Setup.exe` (3.5 MB)
- Gumroad upload: pending user action

## Key Decisions

See .planning/PROJECT.md Key Decisions table — full log with outcomes.

## Known Issues (Carried Forward)

- COPY_PLUGIN_AFTER_BUILD requires elevated process — use fix-install.ps1 manually after rebuild
- Code signing deferred — SmartScreen "More info / Run anyway" for v1; unsigned EXE acceptable

## Pending Todos

(none)

## Blockers / Concerns

(none — v1.0 is clean)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-24
Stopped at: Post-v1.0 patch session — 6 changes committed (cca86c6): joystick movement gate, Roland knobs, sustain CC64, defaults, slew removed
Resume file: none

## Post-v1.0 Patches Applied This Session

- **7693feb** fix(trigger): joystick mode movement-based gate — retriggers on pitch change, 200ms still close
- **c9ed0f5** fix: chromatic transpose (globalTranspose now after quantization) + restore navy colour scheme

Next: /gsd:new-milestone for v1.1
