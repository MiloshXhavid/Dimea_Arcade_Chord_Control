# ChordJoystick

## What This Is

ChordJoystick is a paid JUCE VST3 MIDI generator plugin for Windows that sends 4-voice chord MIDI data to an external synthesizer. Musicians control chord voicings in real time by moving an XY joystick (Y axis = Root + Third, X axis = Fifth + Tension), quantizing to a selected scale. The plugin can be driven by mouse/keyboard or optionally by a PS4/PS5/Xbox gamepad, and includes a DAW-synced looper for recording and replaying joystick gestures and trigger events with live or post-record quantization.

## Core Value

An XY joystick mapped to harmonic space — combined with per-note trigger gates, scale quantization, a gesture looper with trigger quantization, and gamepad control — that no existing MIDI tool provides as a unified instrument.

### Active — v1.6

(Define with `/gsd:new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Audio synthesis | Plugin sends MIDI only |
| Built-in preset browser | DAW preset management sufficient |
| MIDI input processing | Plugin generates, does not process |
| Standalone app mode | VST3 host required |
| macOS / Linux support | Windows first, cross-platform deferred to v2 |
| MPE / polyphonic expression | Standard MIDI channels only |
| Code signing | SmartScreen acceptable for v1; deferred to v2 |
| Looper joystick quantization | Only gate event quantization in scope |

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: JUCE 8 + CMake — locked, all MIDI plugin infrastructure follows JUCE patterns
- **Gamepad**: SDL2 static lib — must initialize with `SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER` only
- **MIDI**: 4 voices across configurable channels + filter CCs (CC74 cutoff, CC71 resonance)
- **Platform**: Windows 11 first; macOS/Linux deferred
- **No audio buses**: Pure MIDI effect — `isBusesLayoutSupported` rejects all audio buses

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| JUCE 8 + CMake FetchContent | Modern JUCE build, no Projucer dependency | ✓ Good |
| SDL2 for gamepad (static) | Cross-platform controller support, normalizes PS4+Xbox | ✓ Good |
| VST3 only (no AU/Standalone) | Windows target, reduce complexity for v1 | ✓ Good |
| CC74 cutoff + CC71 resonance | MIDI standard filter CCs | ✓ Good |
| Sample-and-hold pitch | Pitch only updates at trigger, not on joystick move | ✓ Good |
| Quantize ties → down (≤ midpoint) | Deterministic at scale note equidistance | ✓ Good |
| 4 voices on channels 1–4 default | Simple routing, user-configurable | ✓ Good |
| isMidiEffect()=true + disabled stereo buses | Ableton placement + pluginval both satisfied | ✓ Good |
| Lock-free LooperEngine (AbstractFifo) | Audio-thread safety, no std::mutex in processBlock | ✓ Good |
| SdlContext process-level singleton | One SDL_Init/SDL_Quit per process | ✓ Good |
| Static CRT (MultiThreaded) | No MSVC redistributable on clean machine | ✓ Good |
| Code signing deferred to v2 | SmartScreen acceptable for v1 | ✓ Acceptable |
| NEVER send CC121 in panic | Downstream VST3 instruments map CC121 to parameters | ✓ Good |
| Panic is one-shot not a mute toggle | 48 CCs, returns to pressable immediately | ✓ Good |
| snapToGrid ties → earlier grid point | CONTEXT.md decision; deterministic behavior | ✓ Good |
| pendingQuantize_ flag for post-record | Audio-thread safe, no mutex needed | ✓ Good |
| scratchDedup_ as class member | Avoids ~49KB stack allocation in applyQuantizeToStore() | ✓ Good |
| Single 30 Hz timer (no second timer) | Position bar + animations driven from existing timerCallback | ✓ Good |
| onConnectionChangeUI passes juce::String | Richer UI (controller type) without extra API call | ✓ Good |
| Border-only section panels | Fills covered drawAbove labels at same Y coordinate | ✓ Good |
| Editor height 790 → 810 | Quantize row (20px) was clipped at 790 | ✓ Good |

## Current Milestone: v1.5 Routing + Expression

**Goal:** Add single-channel MIDI routing, per-voice sub octave, LFO recording, left-stick modulation targets, gamepad Option Mode 1 arp control, and fix known looper/BT crash bugs.

**Target features:**
- Single Channel mode — all 4 voices → configurable MIDI channel, note-collision safe
- Sub Octave per voice — parallel note 1 oct lower, Split Hold/SubOct pad button, R3+pad shortcut
- Left Joystick X/Y modulation targets expanded: LFO freq / shape / level / arp gate len
- LFO recording — arm button, records 1 loop cycle, locked playback mode, Distort stays adjustable, Clear button
- Option Mode 1 Arp: Circle = Arp on/off, Triangle = Rate, Square = Order, X = RND Sync; remove R3 panic
- Bug fixes: looper start position after rec cycle; PS4 BT reconnect crash
